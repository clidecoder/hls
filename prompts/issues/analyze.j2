## Analysis Instructions
Analyze this GitHub issue and provide:

1. **Priority Level** (High/Medium/Low) - Based on urgency and impact
2. **Category** - What type of issue this is (bug, feature request, documentation, etc.)
3. **Suggested Labels** - Appropriate labels for this issue
4. **Recommended Action** - What should be done next
5. **Estimated Complexity** - How complex this issue appears to be

**Important**: If this appears to be a test issue, spam, duplicate, or clearly invalid issue that should be closed, include the exact phrase "RECOMMENDATION: CLOSE ISSUE" in your response.

Examples of issues that should be closed:
- Test issues with titles like "test", "testing", "sample"
- Empty or meaningless descriptions
- Obvious spam or promotional content
- Duplicate issues already tracked elsewhere
- Issues that are not actually issues (questions better suited for discussions)

Provide your analysis in a clear, helpful format for repository maintainers.
