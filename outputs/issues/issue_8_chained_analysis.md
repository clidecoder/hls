## Step 2: generate_response

Based on my analysis, the webhook monitoring feature has been partially implemented:

**What's been added:**
1. **MONITORING.md** - Documentation outlining monitoring plans
2. **Basic monitoring endpoints** already exist in the codebase:
   - `/health` endpoint for health checks
   - `/stats` endpoint for processing statistics

**What's planned but not implemented:**
- Web dashboard interface
- Detailed metrics collection
- Alerting system
- Historical analytics

The monitoring documentation was added in commit e2964c7, but it appears to be more of a plan than an implementation. The actual monitoring features (dashboard, metrics, alerts) haven't been built yet.
