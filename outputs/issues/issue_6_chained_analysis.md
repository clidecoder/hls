# Chained Analysis for Issue #6

## Step 1: initial_analysis

Based on the git status and files, I can see:

**Modified Files:**
- `clients.py`: Added conversation history support to ClaudeClient for chained prompts
- `handlers.py`: Imported chained handlers at the end

**New Files:**
- Webhook infrastructure: `ecosystem.config.js`, `hls-webhook.service`, `start-webhook.sh`, `stop-webhook.sh`
- Chained prompt system: `chained_handlers.py`, `chained_issue_handler.py`
- Documentation: `docs/` directory
- Examples: `examples/` directory
- New prompts: `prompts/issues/analyze.md`, `prompts/issues/respond.md`

This appears to be a legitimate GitHub webhook handler service that integrates with Claude AI. The project uses:
- nginx → webhook service → Python dispatch architecture
- Chained prompts for multi-step AI analysis
- Production deployment scripts and systemd service

The `add-webhook-monitoring` branch adds infrastructure for running the webhook as a production service.
