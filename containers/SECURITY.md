# Security Considerations for HLS Docker Deployment

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. Binary Verification
The app Dockerfile downloads binaries without checksum verification. Before production:
- Add SHA256 verification for webhook binary
- Use official Docker images where possible
- Pin all versions explicitly

### 2. Process Management
The current nginx Dockerfile has signal handling issues:
- Consider using an init system (tini) or supervisor
- Implement proper health checks
- Use official nginx image's entrypoint pattern

### 3. Secrets Management
Currently using environment variables for secrets. For production:
- Use Docker secrets or external secret management
- Never commit .env files with real values
- Rotate secrets regularly

### 4. Rate Limiting
No rate limiting is currently configured. Add:
- nginx rate limiting for webhook endpoints
- Application-level rate limiting
- Consider fail2ban for repeated failures

### 5. Monitoring
Implement comprehensive monitoring:
- Log aggregation (ELK stack or similar)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus)
- Alerting for failed webhook validations

## Quick Security Checklist

- [ ] Enable firewall rules (only allow 80/443 inbound)
- [ ] Implement IP allowlisting for GitHub webhooks
- [ ] Regular security updates for all containers
- [ ] Enable SELinux/AppArmor if available
- [ ] Regular backup of configuration and certificates
- [ ] Monitor for CVEs in dependencies
- [ ] Implement request ID tracking across services
- [ ] Add audit logging for all webhook processing

## Production Hardening

1. **Network Security**:
   - Use Docker networks to isolate services
   - Only expose necessary ports
   - Consider using a WAF

2. **Container Security**:
   - Run security scanning on images
   - Use read-only root filesystems where possible
   - Drop unnecessary capabilities

3. **Application Security**:
   - Validate all inputs
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Never log sensitive data

## Incident Response

Have a plan for:
- Compromised webhook secret
- DDoS attacks on webhook endpoint
- Certificate expiration
- Container escape attempts
