#### 3. Configure nginx
Add to your nginx site configuration:
```nginx
server {
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    # Webhook endpoint for GitHub
    location /hooks {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:9000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        
        # Preserve GitHub webhook headers
        proxy_set_header X-GitHub-Event $http_x_github_event;
        proxy_set_header X-GitHub-Delivery $http_x_github_delivery;
        proxy_set_header X-Hub-Signature-256 $http_x_hub_signature_256;
        
        # Increase timeout for Claude processing
        proxy_read_timeout 300s;
        client_max_body_size 10M;
    }
    
    listen 443 ssl;
    # SSL certificates configured by certbot or manually
}
```

### Configuration

#### 1. Edit `config/settings.yaml`:
```yaml
github:
  token: "ghp_your_github_token"
  webhook_secret: "generate_secure_secret_with_openssl"
  
claude:
  api_key: "claude-code"  # or your Anthropic API key

repositories:
  - name: "your-org/your-repo"
    enabled: true
    events: ["issues", "pull_request"]
    labels:
      auto_apply: true
    comments:
      auto_post: true

features:
  signature_validation: true
  auto_labeling: true
  auto_commenting: true
```

#### 2. Generate webhook secret:
```bash
# Generate secure webhook secret
openssl rand -hex 32
```

#### 3. Update webhook dispatch script shebang:
```bash
# Edit webhook_dispatch.py first line to use venv Python
#!/home/your-user/hls/venv/bin/python
```

#### 4. Set up GitHub webhook:
```bash
# Use the setup script
source venv/bin/activate
python setup_github_webhook.py

# Or manually in GitHub repository settings:
# - URL: https://your-domain.com/hooks/github-webhook
# - Content type: application/json
# - Secret: Same as webhook_secret in settings.yaml
# - Events: Issues, Pull requests, etc.
```

### Running

#### 1. Start webhook service:
```bash
# Run webhook service (port 9000)
webhook -hooks hooks.json -port 9000 -verbose

# Or run in background
webhook -hooks hooks.json -port 9000 -verbose > webhook.log 2>&1 &
```

#### 2. (Optional) Run FastAPI service:
```bash
# Only needed if you want direct API access
# The webhook service calls webhook_dispatch.py directly
source venv/bin/activate
python -m hls.src.hls_handler.main
```

#### 3. Monitor logs:
```bash
# Webhook service logs
tail -f webhook.log

# Application logs
tail -f logs/webhook.log
```

## 🔗 Chained Prompts

### What are Chained Prompts?

Chained prompts break complex AI analysis into multiple focused steps, maintaining context between each step for better reasoning and more accurate results.

### Example: Issue Analysis Chain

1. **Step 1 - Analysis**: Understand the issue and extract structured data
   - Categorize as bug/feature/question
   - Assess priority and complexity
   - Extract technical areas and requirements

2. **Step 2 - Response**: Generate appropriate response using analysis data
   - Welcome the contributor
   - Provide specific guidance based on issue type
   - Suggest next steps and timeline

### Benefits

- **Better Accuracy** - Each step focuses on a specific task
- **Context Preservation** - Conversation history maintained between steps
- **Structured Data** - Extract and use metadata between steps
- **Flexible Workflows** - Easy to add/modify steps

### Configuration

```yaml
prompts:
  templates:
    issues:
      analyze: "issues/analyze.md"    # Step 1: Analysis
      respond: "issues/respond.md"    # Step 2: Response
```

See [Chained Prompts Guide](docs/CHAINED_PROMPTS.md) for implementation details.

## ⏰ Backup Processing (Cron Jobs)

### Automatic Issue Detection

A cron job runs every hour to find and process issues that may have been missed by webhooks:

- **Smart Detection** - Finds issues older than 30 minutes without `clide-analyzed` label
- **Same Quality** - Uses identical chained prompt analysis as webhooks  
- **Safety Mechanisms** - Rate limiting and concurrent execution prevention
- **Comprehensive Logging** - Detailed logs for monitoring and debugging

### Manual Processing

```bash
# Test mode (find issues without processing)
python3 scripts/analyze_missed_issues.py --dry-run

# Process issues older than 1 hour
python3 scripts/analyze_missed_issues.py --min-age 60

# Check what would be processed
python3 scripts/analyze_missed_issues.py --dry-run --min-age 30
```

### Configuration

```yaml
cron_analysis:
  enabled: true
  min_age_minutes: 30        # Only process issues older than 30 minutes
  max_issues_per_repo: 10    # Safety limit per repository  
  delay_between_issues: 2    # Seconds between processing
```

See [Cron Jobs Documentation](docs/CRON_JOBS.md) for complete setup guide.

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Real-Time Monitoring

```bash
# Check processing status
curl http://localhost:8000/stats

## Processing Flow Example

When a new issue is created on GitHub:

1. **GitHub sends webhook** to `https://your-domain.com/hooks/github-webhook`
2. **nginx receives HTTPS request** and proxies to webhook service on port 9000
3. **webhook service validates** the request matches `hooks.json` rules
4. **webhook service executes** `webhook_dispatch.py` with:
   - JSON payload as command argument
   - GitHub headers as environment variables
5. **webhook_dispatch.py**:
   - Loads settings from `config/settings.yaml`
   - Validates webhook signature (HMAC-SHA256)
   - Checks repository and event configuration
   - Initializes WebhookProcessor
6. **WebhookProcessor routes** to appropriate handler (e.g., IssueHandler)
7. **Handler processes event**:
   - Loads Jinja2 prompt template
   - Sends prompt to Claude for analysis
   - Parses Claude's response for labels and actions
8. **GitHub API updates**:
   - Applies suggested labels
   - Posts analysis comment
   - Marks issue as analyzed
9. **Response returned** to GitHub with processing status

## Customization

### Custom Prompts
Edit templates in the `prompts/` directory to customize Claude's analysis:

```jinja2
{# prompts/issues/analyze.j2 #}
Analyze this GitHub issue for {{ repository.name }}:

Title: {{ issue.title }}
Body: {{ issue.body }}
Author: {{ issue.user.login }}

Provide:
1. Priority (high/medium/low)
2. Difficulty (easy/moderate/complex)
3. Component (frontend/backend/database)
4. Suggested labels
```

### Repository-Specific Configuration
Configure different behavior per repository:

```yaml
repositories:
  - name: "org/frontend-repo"
    events: ["issues", "pull_request"]
    labels:
      categories: ["bug", "enhancement", "ui-ux"]
  
  - name: "org/backend-repo"
    events: ["issues", "pull_request", "workflow_run"]
    labels:
      categories: ["bug", "enhancement", "performance", "security"]
```

## Monitoring

### Health Checks
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Statistics
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/stats
```

### Logs
```bash
tail -f logs/hsl.log
```
