# Test PR for webhook system

This pull request tests the webhook monitoring system by creating a PR that should trigger the Claude analysis.

## What this tests:
- PR webhook delivery from GitHub
- nginx SSL proxy to webhook service 
- webhook service execution of dispatch script
- Python module loading and analysis
- Claude AI integration
- GitHub API label and comment posting

The webhook should automatically analyze this PR and post a comment with its assessment.

## Update: Added PR Analysis Templates

This update adds the missing pull request analysis templates that were causing the webhook to fail. The templates include:

- `new_pr.md` - For newly opened pull requests
- `pr_updated.md` - For pull request updates  
- `default.md` - Fallback template

These templates are configured to provide technical analysis without mentioning AI tools or including disclaimers.
